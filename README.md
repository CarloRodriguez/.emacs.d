# My personal Emacs configuration

An ever-changing set of my Emacs configurations.

## Setup

In my `.emacs` I have:
```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/init")
(require 'init)
```

## This is an Emacs Mac OS X configuration

I install Emacs from homebrew:

`brew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head --cocoa --with-gnutls`

## This is an Emacs MacBook Pro Spanish keyboard configuration

I like command key mapped as control key and Caps Lock key as Meta
key, this configuration also has spanish symbols and adaptations for
programing.

## Works done with this configuration

  * Web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  * Java development.
  * PHP development.
  * Emacs Lisp hacks.

## Emacs 24.4 tested configuration
