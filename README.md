# My personal Emacs configuration

An ever-changing set of my Emacs configurations.

## Setup

In my `.emacs` I have:
```elisp
(load "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
```

## This is an Emacs under OS X configuration

I install Emacs with homebrew:

`brew install emacs --cocoa --with-gnutls`

## Works done with this configuration

  * Web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  * Java development.
  * PHP development.
  * Emacs Lisp hacks.
  * Python scripts.

## Emacs 24.4.1 tested configuration
