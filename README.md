# My personal Emacs configuration

An ever-changing set of my Emacs configurations. I'm just starting to use Emacs seriously so it keeps getting improved.

## Setup

In my `.emacs` I have:
```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/init")
(require 'init)
```

## This is an Emacs Mac OS X configuration

I use Emacs from [Emacs For Mac OS X](http://emacsformacosx.com/)

## This is an Emacs MacBook Pro Spanish keyboard configuration

I like command key mapped as control key and Caps Lock key as Meta key, this configuration also has spanish symbols and adaptations for programing.

## Works done with this configuration

  * Web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  * Java development.
  * PHP development.
  * Emacs Lisp hacks.

## Emacs 24.3 tested configuration
